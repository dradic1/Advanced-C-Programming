# Advanced Programming Project  

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course at the university.  
The main objective of the project was to apply concepts learned during the course and demonstrate problem-solving skills using the **C programming language** as the primary language.

## About the Project  
The project consists of two main parts:  

### 1. Circular Doubly Linked List Module  
A module was implemented to represent a **circular doubly linked list**, designed as a **static library**.  
The module provides the following functionalities:  
- Initialization of the list (with dynamic memory allocation)  
- Deletion of the list  
- Adding elements to the list  
- Deleting all elements from the list  
- Printing all elements in the list  
- Checking if the list is empty (`isEmpty`)  

The list structure contains pointers to both the **head** and the **tail** elements, enabling efficient navigation in both directions.  

### 2. Football Team Statistics Application  
Using the circular doubly linked list module, an application was developed to manage **football team statistics**.  
Each player is described by the following attributes:  
- First name  
- Last name  
- Age  
- Position played  
- Number of assists  
- Number of goals  

The application allows users to:  
- Browse players by **position**  
- Sort and view players by **number of goals**  
- Sort and view players by **number of assists**  

This practical example demonstrates the integration of data structures with real-world problem-solving in sports data management.

## Technologies Used  
- **C language** (main programming language)  
- Standard libraries and compiler tools  

---

## Purpose  
The project served as a **faculty assignment** and was designed to showcase the ability to implement complex programming tasks using C.  
It reflects both theoretical understanding and practical application of advanced programming concepts, particularly focusing on **data structures, modular design, and static libraries**.
